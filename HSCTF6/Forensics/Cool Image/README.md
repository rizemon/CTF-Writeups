# Cool Image

Written by: cppio

My friend told me he found a really cool image, but I couldn't open it. Can you help me access the image?

File: cool.pdf

## Solution

Instead of an image, we get a .pdf file ? Let's run ```file``` to find out more.

Turns out the extension is wrong and it is actually a .png file. Lets fix the extension and open it.
